# 2b2t mods

This is Tilley8's 2b2t modpack. 

It has all of the mods required for a good experience on 2b2t. 

I use it in combination with Future Client and Rusherhack. 

None of these mods are made by me, and I do not claim ownership of any of them. 

(I may make some mods of my own sometime, but they are not ready by any means to go public lol)

- Future Client
  
  A great hacked client/utility mod I use mainly for PvP.
  
  You need to run the installer you get from the forum before it will function properly. 
  
  If you do not intend to pay for Future Client, simply remove the mod from your mods folder after downloading the zip or cloning the repo.

  The name of the mod file is client-1.20.3-1.20.1.jar
