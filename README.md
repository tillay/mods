# 2b2t mods

This is Tilley8's 2b2t modpack. 

It has all of the mods required for a good experience on 2b2t. 

I use it in combination with Future Client and Rusherhack. 

None of these mods are made by me, and I do not claim ownership of any of them. 

(I may make some mods of my own sometime, but they are not ready by any means to go public lol)
